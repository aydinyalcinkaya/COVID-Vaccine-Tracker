# COVID Vaccine Tracker
A RESTful web app meant to track COVID-19 vaccinations. Made with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

This program is being developed as my ICS4U1 summative project. 
Since it is a summative, it will not function as an actual tracker, instead it uses fake information to work as a proof-of-concept.
